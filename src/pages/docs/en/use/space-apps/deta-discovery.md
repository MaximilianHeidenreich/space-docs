In the background, Space is pulling a copy of the app from Discovery and provisioning the compute and data resources to run the app out of your Space. Once it is complete, you will be able to find the app on your Canvas. Your app comes with its own, unique domain. It also comes pre-wired to its own unique Collection for storing associated data.
