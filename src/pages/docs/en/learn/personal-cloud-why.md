# Why the personal cloud?

WIP

> Deta's motivation for Space is [here](https://deta.space/motivation/). Below is a bit more about why the personal cloud may make sense for developers and users alike.

For developers, the personal cloud makes building and globally distributing web applications simple. For users, it brings the autonomy of personal computers online.

Together, we think these things form a new frontier of possibilities.

## **Little effort, massive availability**

Using the cloud providers of today, web developers with an idea need to do a lot to bring it to the world.

They have to code their idea, but they also have to create, pay for, and operate the infrastructure to run it. This is a lot of work. For apps to serve users around the globe, this barrier usually requires teams of operational experts fighting [a large number of cloud tools](https://landscape.cncf.io/).

Using the personal cloud, things are different. Individuals just write the code for their app, assuming that they're the only user. Then, they can deploy their app to their own cloud and use it privately for themselves. If they want to share it with the world, they can publish it. And anyone else with an internet connection can install the app, in another personal cloud.

Along the way, each user gets their own infrastructure. Consequently, developers have effectively 0 operational burden, no matter how many users their app gets.

## **Fine-grained control**

In the traditional cloud model, the company who provides an application holds a lot of power. If the company decides it's not worth it to keep the app running and shuts down the infrastructure, happy users lose access. They also can't easily interact with, extend, or delete their own application data. Or add a custom domain, or more RAM to a sluggish service.

On the personal cloud, this all changes. Users can install and uninstall apps on a whim, with fine-grained control. They can inspect, modify, extend, and export all their data. They can even run their own code, to plug into everything that's already there.

They can just write code for an app, and then publish it to the world.

Everything belonging to a user is right their in front of them, under their fine-grained control. They can view, edit, extend and export all their data, as well as store new stuff. They can spin up new scripts and services. Since it's all in one place, it can integrate directly. And lastly, for users who are also developers, the control is extremely powerful: everything is raw material to build and explore with.

In this way, a personal cloud is like a personal computer.

## **New possibilities**

## **A personal space, and a portal to the world**

Unlike a personal computer, a personal cloud lives in the web. So it's not just an autonomous and private home for all your stuff. It's also a personal portal to and from the rest of the world. It's a place not only to author, but to publish, receive, and engage. It's a launchpad for everything in it to interact with the rest of the world, human and machine. And it's a place to discover and use incredible things that others are creating.
