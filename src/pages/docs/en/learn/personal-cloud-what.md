# What is the personal cloud?

WIP

A personal cloud is an approach to cloud computing for individuals, a shift away from the dominant model of cloud computing — "the public cloud".

### **The public cloud**

Most cloud providers are "public clouds". Their customers are largely companies, which sit between end users, the app, and user data. Most individuals never interact with a cloud provider directly.

This model is visible in the relationships between users, an application, and infrastructure in a "public cloud" app:

In this set up, end users of an app by-and-large share 'computing' resources: servers, databases, file stores, and more. These resources are managed by the application provider. End users of the application log in and interact with them through the application provider, who gives them selective access.

On top of this, every individual user interacts with many different applications …

### **The personal cloud**

The "personal cloud" is a return to the personal computer model, but in the cloud. A personal cloud provider largely serves individuals, who get their own personal cloud.

In the personal cloud, the relationships between users, applications, and infrastructure change:

GRAPHIC

In this model, apps aren't made up of one giant shared pool of resources for all users. Instead, each user gets a logically separate copy of each app, backed by computing resources in their own cloud. These resources are managed and controlled by the end user, who logs in to their cloud directly.

At Deta, we think this shift solves a number of hairy problems for both individual developers and users.
