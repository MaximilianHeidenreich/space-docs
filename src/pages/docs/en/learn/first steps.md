Deta is building a personal computer on the internet — "a personal cloud" — called Deta Space. If you build software for the internet, Space wants to make it dramatically easier to do so. If you're a user of the internet, Space wants to bring the freedom of personal computing to your life online.

## **What's a personal cloud and why should I care?**

You likely already use web apps such as Google Docs, Figma, or ChatGPT. When you use them, you interact with big, remote, computers on the internet (”the cloud”).  These computers are controlled by the providers of each app, and are largely walled gardens. If you want to unlock your data or get multiple internet apps to interact, it’s either difficult or impossible.

A personal cloud is also a remote computer on the internet that runs web apps and stores data. But it’s a computer that’s **personal**, a computer that puts you in the driver’s seat. You control it — it’s apps and data are yours to direct and unleash. 

Compared to traditional ways of using the internet, a personal cloud is designed to:

- give users fine-grained control over their apps and data
- make building and sharing internet software simple
- enable radically new possibilities for your life online

## **What about Deta Space?**

Deta Space is Deta's personal cloud. Space offers a growing catalogue of internet software for you to discover and use.

With Space, you can build apps for yourself, using languages and frameworks you know and love. If you like, you can share your creations with the world in a single click.
