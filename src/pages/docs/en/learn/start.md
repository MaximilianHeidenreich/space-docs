Deta is building personal computers on the internet - "personal clouds" - with a product called Deta Space. If you're a user, Space wants to bring the freedom of personal computing to your life on the internet. If you're a software developer, Space wants to make it dramatically easier to build and share web applications with the world.

## What's a personal cloud and why should I care?

As mentioned, a personal cloud is a computer on the internet. Like a personal computer, you can install and use applications and store data in a space that's yours. But unlike a personal computer, all the data and apps tie into the power of the web. Everything on a personal cloud is accessible across your devices, and it can interact with the rest of the world.

The apps on a personal cloud [operate differently](/en/introduction/personal-cloud#the-personal-cloud) than most web applications that you probably already use on a ["public cloud"](/en/introduction/personal-cloud#the-public-cloud). The difference is that the "cloud-computer" that runs the apps and stores data lives with the end-user, not the parties that build the apps. 

This difference has a few big consequences. First, it means that the user has a lot more control. Second, it removes the need for software developers to worry about running big, complicated, and expensive cloud servers to bring their ideas to the world. And lastly, it unlocks a new horizon of possibilities for computers, one that traditional apps on both personal computers and the public cloud can't reach.
