At Deta, we are building a personal computer that lives in the cloud â€” a personal cloud â€” for individual software developers. We call it Deta Space.

## Build it for yourself, and see it run anywhere

Developing for Space is simple. Use familiar programming languages and friendly tools to **build your idea for yourself**. Once you've done that, you can **see your idea run anywhere, for anyone with an internet connection**. It doesn't require any extra effort at all - this is baked in to the idea of "the personal cloud".

With the personal cloud, we see a future where individuals are empowered with apps and data that they can unleash and extend, in their own personal clouds. A future where personal clouds can connect with each other and collaborate. And a future where developers can release their brilliant ideas to a whole world of clouds, with very little effort.

Learn more about our vision on the [Why Deta Space](https://deta.space/motivation/) page and check out our [intro to the Personal Cloud](/docs/en/introduction/personal-cloud) for an overview of the core concepts.

## âœ¨ Key features

Deta Space is standing behind you, fully.

- **Fully managed servers**: App developers have an ops burden of zero, as they scale their users to space.

- **Fully managed data**: App developers don't have to worry about user data/compliance.

- **Fully managed security**: App developers don't think about security and auth - each user gets their own sandboxed app with managed auth.

- **Fully managed payments**: App developers can earn money with their apps, activated easy-peasy (planned).
