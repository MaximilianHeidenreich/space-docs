This quickstart assumes that you have:

- A [Deta Space account](https://deta.space/signup)
- [Space CLI](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/cli) installed on your machine and logged in
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/install) installed on your machine

> üí° Currently, Space only supports Node.js 16, with plans to add support for Node.js 18 soon.
We recommend using a Node version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node.js and npm on your computer. This will allow you to quickly install and use different versions of Node.js.

Space supports popular front-end frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/), [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), making it easy to run your static apps on Space with these frameworks. However, if you're building static HTML apps without using a framework or static site generator, or if you're using a framework like [Astro](https://astro.build/), [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), or any other that's not yet supported out of the box, you can still run it on Space by configuring the [Spacefile](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile).

You can use your existing static app or you can create one.

## Create a Space project

[Space projects](https://deta.space/docs/en/basics/projects) allow you to build and test apps with different Space features before releasing it to the public. To create a Space project, run the following command in the static app directory:

```bash
space new
```

You will be prompted to enter a name for your project. The CLI will then display a generated configuration for the app and prompt you to confirm the setup of the project with that configuration. Once confirmed, the project will be created along with a Spacefile that contains the configuration for the micro and a `.space` directory that stores project information and links it to your Builder project.

      engine: vue
      primary: true
  ```
  </Fragment>
</EngineTabs>

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If the CLI fails to generate a configuration for your app, you can configure it manually. For more information, please refer to [this](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile).

If you're building a static HTML app without using a framework or static site generator, or if you're using a framework that's not yet supported out of the box, here is how to configure the Spacefile to work with your specific requirements.

```yaml
# Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
v: 0
micros:
  - name: static-app
    src: ./
    engine: static
    primary: true
    commands:
      - npm run build
    serve: dist
```

Here, the [`engine`](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile#engine) parameter specifies the type of engine used for the app, which is `static` in this case. The [`commands`](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile#commands) parameter is a list of commands that will be executed to build the app. The [`serve`](https://deta.space/docs/en/reference/spacefile#serve) parameter specifies the directory that will be served as the root directory for the app, and in this case, the `dist` directory is used.

## Developing Locally

To develop your app on your local machine, you can define what command should be executed to start your app's development server with the `dev` command in the Spacefile. With this the CLI will take care of generating and injecting the `Data Key` for easier access to app's Base and Drive instances with SDKs, as well as testing scheduled actions, so you can focus on developing your app without worrying about configuring these all by yourself.

  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: react-app
      src: ./
      engine: react
      primary: true
  +   dev: npm run start
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="svelte">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: svelte-app
      src: ./
      engine: svelte
      primary: true
  +   dev: npm run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
  <Fragment slot="vue">
  ```diff
  # Spacefile Docs: https://go.deta.dev/docs/spacefile/v0
  v: 0
  micros:
    - name: vue-app
      src: ./
      engine: vue
      primary: true
  +   dev: npm run dev
  ```
  </Fragment>
</EngineTabs>

Once you define the `dev` command for the micro in the Spacefile, you can start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
space dev
```

## Run it on Space

To deploy your app to Space, simply run:

```diff
space push
```

This will validate your Spacefile, then package and upload your source code to Space build pipeline, and stream logs of the whole process on your terminal. Once the build process is complete, the builder instance will be updated and the CLI will return the link to the Builder instance. Open it in your browser and you got your app running on Space.

> üí° You can use `space push --open` to open the builder instance in your browser after successful deployment and update of the builder instance.

Congratulations! üéâ You have successfully built, deployed and got your first Static app on Space. üöÄ
