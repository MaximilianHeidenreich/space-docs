### Will my Micros, Bases, Drives Continue to wok?

Yes, they will continue to work until May 1, 2023. After that they will be sunset. 

You will continue to be able to update Micros as well as use your Bases and Drives until May 1, but you won't be able to create new Projects or Micros.

We recommend moving [Bases and Drives to Collections](/migration/migration-guides/import-a-project) and [Micros to Space Apps](/migration/migration-guides/migrate-a-micro).

[Custom domains](https://deta.space/manual/features/custom-domains) are available on Deta Space. Custom sub-domains (`<sub>.deta.dev`) are not currently available.

### Can I run a cron job in Space?

Yes, you can run up multiple [Scheduled Actions](https://deta.space/manual/features/scheduled-actions) in a single Space App.

No plans to bring VISOR to Space, but we plan to continuously improve Logs in Deta Space.

### Is Space free like Deta Cloud was? What are the limits?

Like Deta Cloud, Deta Space is free for developers building apps. For usage, free tier limits and a premium "Deta Adventurer" plan will be announced soon.
