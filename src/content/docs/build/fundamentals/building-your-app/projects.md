## **What’s a Project?**

When building apps for Space, the first thing you start with is a **Project**. A Project is where you build, test, and release apps it to the public. Projects in Space live inside Builder, a system application in every developer’s Space for building and managing other Space apps.  Learn more about Builder in “**What is Builder**”.

## **Creating a Project**

💡 For a complete beginners guide checkout our “Building your first Space app” guide or the “New Space App” page.

You can create new a new Project using the Space CLI. If you haven’t install or set up the Space CLI, do that now by following ******************The Space CLI****************** page.

To create a new Builder Project, open a new terminal, navigate into a new directory (or the directory of app you want to push to Space) and run the `space new`  command:

```
space new
```

Enter a name for your Project when prompted. The Space CLI should try to detect existing applications in your local directory. If found, you can see the config generated by the CLI for those applications. Here’s an example config for a simple X app:

EXAMPLE CONFIG

Confirm the generated configuration, if it is correct for your app. The CLI should create a new Project in Builder and generate a `Spacefile` in your local directory. This `Spacefile` contains the configuration of your app, used by Deta Space to understand what your app looks like and how to run it. You can read more about the `Spacefile` in the **************************Space Runtime************************** page.

Additionally, the CLI should create a hidden `.space` directory locally — this contains information about your Project, linking your local directory to Builder. This directory should not be included in your version control and was automatically added to your `.gitignore`.

> Builder doesn’t keep track of your source code, we recommend you use Git as a version control system.

### **Project Linking**

Your local development environment is connected to Builder via the hidden `.space` directory, which contains a unique identifier: a *Project ID*. When you run `space new`, the Space CLI will automatically connect the local directory via this *Project ID* with a newly created Project in Builder.

You can also connect any directory to any existing Builder Project via this **********Project ID********** and the `space link` CLI command. To do so, navigate to the directory you want to link and enter the command:

```
space link
```

`space link` prompts you to enter a *Project ID.* Entering it links the directory with your Project in Builder via the local `.space` sub-directory. You can get your *************Project ID************* under the your Project’s “Develop” tab in Builder.

## Managing **Projects in Builder**

Now that you’ve created or linked a project, you can view and manage it inside the Builder app, which can be found on your Canvas in Space.

Each Project in Builder consists of 3 main pages:

**Overview**: where you see important information about your Project, like its latest Release and recent events.

**Develop**: where you to manage your project’s development.

The “Overview” sub-tab is where you can access your **Builder Instance**, and see it’s **Logs**.

The “Data” sub-tab is where you access your Project’s data, which you can view, edit and manage via ********************Drive UI, Base UI********************, and ********************Data Keys.********************

The  “Configuration” sub-tab is where you can manage your Builder Instance’s configuration — both **environment variables**, that you can define in your `Spacefile`, and ****************************Custom Domains****************************.

**Publish**: where you create and manage Releases of your app
